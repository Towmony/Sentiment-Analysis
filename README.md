# Sentiment-Analysis
The code is performing sentiment analysis (classification) of a set of sentences each with a label (0/1) that is used for training. I used Convolutional Neural Network to train the model and then perform classification.
The accuracy is about 50%.

There are a lot to improve of course :D
